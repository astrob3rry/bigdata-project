# Spatial Data Profiling

## Descripiton

Open data often comes with little or no metadata, which makes it difficult to search for and find relevant datasets for a given information need. Therefore, the main goal for our project is to figure out a reliable and accurate way to provide informative summaries on spatial data for open data. 
We will profile 150 open data sets on spatial data which are selected from [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us) using existing tools/libraries to identify their spatial attributes, and then try to come up with new techniques based on that to improve the precision and recall of the existing method.
